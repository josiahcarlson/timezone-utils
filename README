This project intends to include various utilities and functions for dealing
with timezones in Python. This is not meant as a replacement for pytz, but as
a useful add on.


The downloadable tz_world.zip contains the input .kml file to be used with the
provided parsing utilities. It is the result of taking the tz_world shapefile
from: http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/ and passing it through Shp2kml:
http://www.zonums.com/shp2kml.html . This data was downloaded and originally
processed in early November 2011.

The operator of http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/ has waived all rights to the
shapefiles, and we do the same to all downloads available:
